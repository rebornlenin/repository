**REBORN LENINISM** <br>

We are, the members of the public association "Revived Leninism",
unite in the conviction that science and technology are the key
to solving global problems and improving the lives of all people.
We set ourselves the task of resurrecting Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov (Lenin) and define his role as a leading one in the construction of a truly Leninist creative society. 
We seek to create a society where everyone can live in conditions that ensure their well-being, equality and sustainable development, in a society that will inevitably lead to the advent of communism. 
The ultimate goal of our public association is to ensure the well-being of all citizens. We pay special attention to social justice, 
equality and sustainable development, understanding that only with equal access to resources and opportunities can everyone reach their potential.
